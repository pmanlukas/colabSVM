# colabSVM

This repository is part of my master thesis at the Technical University of Munich about Classifiers for openAPI specified web services for service discovery.

The classifiers are based on a Support Vector Machine with Stochastic Gradient Descent implemented in Scikit-Learn. The code was implemented in a Jupyter Notebook hosted on Google coLaboratory. The source code in this repository is therefore implemented as a Jupyter Notebook and can be run either in Colab or on a custom installation of Jupyter.

## Testing:

You can clone this repository and start the notebooks with jupyter. Alternative is to import them to Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/
